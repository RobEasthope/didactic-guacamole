# didactic-guacamole

A *very, very* simple bootstrapped Wordpress site primarily integrating the Advanced Custom Fields plugin

Built off the full Roots package:
* Trellis - A Vagrant/Ansible stack
* Bedrock - Cleans up the Wordpress install to ease development
* Sage - A simple starter theme with Gulp preprocessing built in
* All plugins and themes installed via Composer
* Soil plugin makes theme-agnostic modifications to Wordpress
* Responsive images handled via the RICG plugin
* SEO handled via Yoast
* Contact form handled via Contact Form 7 (Gravity form requires a fee)
* Project name randomly generated by Github

Outstanding issues
* The category templates need to be spun out to their own modular templates
